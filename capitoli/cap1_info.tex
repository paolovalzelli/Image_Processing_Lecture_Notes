\subsection{Learning outcomes}

At the end of the course, the student will be able to: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item describe the basic issues and the principal applications of image processing;
    \item demonstrate a good understanding of the current state-of-the-art image processing methods;
    \item identify, demonstrate, and apply his/her knowledge by analysing image processing problems and recognising and employing (or proposing) effective solutions;
    \item identify, demonstrate, and apply his/her knowledge by analysing image processing problems and recognising and employing (or proposing) effective solutions;
    \item identify, demonstrate, and apply his/her knowledge by analysing image processing problems and recognsing and employing (or proposing) effective solutions;
    \item design and create practical solutions to a range of common image processing problems.
\end{itemize}

The student will also get the basic knowledge on the main algorithms for: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item filtering in the spatial and frequency domain;
    \item image segmentation;
    \item object detection and recognition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Course contents}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Visual perception;
    \item Image formation: geometry and radiometry;
    \item From analogue to digital images;
    \item Digital image chain: acquisition, visualisation and processing;
    \item Image processing:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Geometric operations;
        \item Point operations;
        \item Local operations;
        \item Image segmentation;
        \item Fourier analysis;
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Item segmentation;
    \item Feature extraction;
    \item Lab session with with ImageJ.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assessment methods}

In the last weeks of the course, students will tackle a real-world problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Group project (small groups: 4 or 5 people);
    \item Reading a scientific paper;
    \item Finding materials (bibliography, images, etc.);
    \item Understanding and implementation of some algorithms;
    \item Presentation (both written report and oral presentation) of the project and its outcomes.
\end{itemize}

Final examination: discussion (not presentation) of the group project and oral interview.
The material available on the course website is not sufficient: in some cases, it is necessary to read further material in the book.
